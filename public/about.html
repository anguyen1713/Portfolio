<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>UCLA Mechanical Engineering B.S, Class of 2026</h2>

<p>I am young and adventurous student looking for a technical outlet for his creativity. With a deep interest in Formula 1
  and NASA, I've always been drawn towards aerospace and learning how to design cars. The pursuit of my engineering
degree is driven by those passions. My ultimate goal as an engineer is to be able to leave the world better than how I 
found it. I aspire to use my skills to provide sustainable clean energy and safety to our world.  </p>
